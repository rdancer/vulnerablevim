>Improper Implementation of shellescape()/Arbitrary Code Execution</span>

1. Summary

Product  : Vim -- Vi IMproved
Version  : &gt;= 7.2a.013; &lt; 7.2b.005; tested with 7.2b
Impact   : Arbitrary code execution
Wherefrom: Local, possibly remote
Original : http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html
           http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-latest.tar.bz2

Improper implementation of the shellescape() function and lack of
documentation can result in untrusted data being insufficiently
sanitized, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.


2. Background

The shellescape() function, added by patch 7.0.111, has since been
modified in 7.2a.013 to escape special characters, so as to be useful
when sanitizing arguments of the ``execute'' command:


``shellescape({string} [, {special}])
    Escape {string} for use as shell command argument.
    [...]
    When the {special} argument is present and it's a non-zero Number or
    a non-empty String [...], then special items such as &quot;%&quot;, &quot;#&quot; and
    &quot;&lt;cword&gt;&quot; will be preceded by a backslash.  This backslash will be
    removed again by the :! command.  Example of use with a :! command:
        :exe '!dir ' . shellescape(expand('&lt;cfile&gt;'), 1)
    This results in a directory listing for the file under the cursor.''

    	-- Vim Reference Manual (``eval.txt'')


3. Vulnerability

shellescape() does not escape all special items.  In particular,
shellescape() does not escape the ``!'' character.

The Vim documentation lacks a comprehensive explicit list of special
items.  This might have been the reason why patch 7.2a.013 failed to
acknowledge ``!'' as a special item.


3. Test Case

We have added a test case to our test suite; run ``make test'' in the
``shellescape'' directory.  The result will show as ``VULNERABLE'' if
the shellescape() function of the version of Vim tested doesn't escape
the ``!'' special item, ``FAILED'' otherwise.


4. Exploit -- Proof of Concept

To show that this vulnerability can be exploited, we have updated our
``tar.vim'' exploit.   Run ``make test'' in the ``tarplugin.v2''
directory.  Please note that the problem lays within the shellescape()
function implementation, rather than within ``tar.vim''.
